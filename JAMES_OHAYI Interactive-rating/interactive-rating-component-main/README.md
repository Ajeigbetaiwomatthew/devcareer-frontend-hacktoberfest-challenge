## Overview
This challenge is meant to help me understand the use of hover state, focus state, Js foreach, the DOs and DON'Ts of their usage too.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - Stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS


### What I learned
I learn't the use of SASS and implementation of array foreach method, see below:


```js
clicks.forEach(click=> {
    click.addEventListener('click', function(){
      clicksIndicator.innerHTML = click.innerHTML;
    })
});
```



### Continued development

In my next project I would continue using SASS so as to perfect it and also improve on my understanding of Js.
